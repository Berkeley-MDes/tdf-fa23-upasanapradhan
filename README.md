### Getting to College ###

This week was all about figuring out the transport and how to get to classes the best route and on time. 

Getting used to the new means of transportation which isn't familiar to you means that you go to the stops way earlier so you don't miss the bus, it means that getting used to the way and finding alternative methods if a plan fails. (In my case, walking to school/)

### Old and New ###

This week I participated in an introductory session on Arduino except of clasees. It was after my first year of engineering that I got to stay in a class as such. It was my first time ever working with an arduino, and a memory with working and basic eletronics from college was reignited.

### A Blank Canvas ###

A notebook to be filled with ideas. Excited with the end of the first week to be working on workshops, gearing up to the classes and the lessons ahead.

### Failing fast ###

Using the Rhino and Grasshopper is new, but starting to learn the software, the requirements and tutorials.

The model was complex to grasp but the video and tutorials helped me along with a few questions that I could search about. 
I started with changing the parameters for the component, what would work and what would fail.

#### Diagram to show my understanding of the model ####
This diagram display the most important features from the model. I tried to break ot dom into simple form to truly understand what is happening.

#### Creating a Pen Stand ####
Learned how to create my own model and progressively learned:
1. Using a cylinder shape as a void
2. Using centers from the top and bottom to create a loft.

Learning a new tool is intimidating but finding success in small step really helps you go on and try new things.


#### My first shot at 3D Printing ####

The fabrication class helped me a lot when I tried to print a model. I was able to get my first ever print with a 3D Printer.
