# Report  - Week of 08/29/2024 #

### Getting to College ###

This week was all about figuring out the transport and how to get to classes the best route and on time. 

Getting used to the new means of transportation which isn't familiar to you means that you go to the stops way earlier so you don't miss the bus, it means that getting used to the way and finding alternative methods if a plan fails. (In my case, walking to school/)

### Old and New ###

This week I participated in an introductory session on Arduino except of clasees. It was after my first year of engineering that I got to stay in a class as such. It was my first time ever working with an arduino, and a memory with working and basic eletronics from college was reignited.

### A Blank Canvas ###

A notebook to be filled with ideas. Excited with the end of the first week to be working on workshops, gearing up to the classes and the lessons ahead.
