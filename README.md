### Getting to College ###

This week was all about figuring out the transport and how to get to classes the best route and on time. 

Getting used to the new means of transportation which isn't familiar to you means that you go to the stops way earlier so you don't miss the bus, it means that getting used to the way and finding alternative methods if a plan fails. (In my case, walking to school.)

### Old and New ###

This week I participated in an introductory session on Arduino except of classes. It was after my first year of engineering that I got to stay in a class as such. It was my first time ever working with an arduino, and a memory with working and basic electronics from college was reignited.

### A Blank Canvas ###

A notebook to be filled with ideas. Excited with the end of the first week to be working on workshops, gearing up to the classes and the lessons ahead.

### Failing fast ###

Using the Rhino and Grasshopper is new, but starting to learn the software, the requirements and tutorials.

<img width="200" alt="Creating a sphere" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-upasanapradhan/blob/main/assets/Rhino.png">

The model was complex to grasp but the video and tutorials helped me along with a few questions that I could search about. 
I started with changing the parameters for the component, what would work and what would fail.

#### Diagram to show my understanding of the model ####
This diagram display the most important features from the model. I tried to break ot dom into simple form to truly understand what is happening.

#### Creating a Pen Stand ####
Learned how to create my own model and progressively learned:
1. Using a cylinder shape as a void
2. Using centers from the top and bottom to create a loft.

Learning a new tool is intimidating but finding success in small step really helps you go on and try new things.


#### My first shot at 3D Printing ####

The fabrication class helped me a lot when I tried to print a model. I was able to get my first ever print with a 3D Printer. 
I plan on getiing the Pen stand 3D printed as well.

# Report - Week 3 (09/14/2024-09/19/2024) #

I sucessfully printed the model for my pen stand.

Here is a moment in time where I was amazed by the power of Grasshopper.

#### Final Hexagonal Mesh Geodesic Design ####

I added and created a honeycomb design with the file given to us by the professor. I was curious what my professor had originally imagined the phone stand to be used for. It was great to hear his answer that although it was intended for a phone stand, people use it as a paperweight and even a penholder.

A final Shot to document my success at the very first project.

<img width="200" alt="Phone Stand" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-upasanapradhan/blob/main/assets/FinalTDFProject01.png">

I had just printed out my stand, Chris and a fellow student helped me click good shots of the stand with a background. This was during the Laser Cutting Bootcamp. You can see a creation made using laser cutting in the reflection. (This is my reflection of the Laser Cutting Bootcamp. :) )

### Moving from 0 to 1, now 1 to 2. ###

The system map focuses on the ecosystem formed by your AirPods or headphones and the audio/video apps (Spotify, YouTube, etc.) they interact with. Key components include the devices (AirPods, headphones, phone), content platforms (Spotify, YouTube), and sound-related system features (volume,noise , pitch)

Connections: The primary device (phone or computer) acts as the hub, connecting your AirPods or headphones to the content platforms. Information flows from the apps, playing music or videos, to your listening devices, where sound is delivered.

Information Flow: The sound (music, video audio) is streamed through apps like Spotify and YouTube, then transmitted wirelessly to AirPods or headphones. Information such as volume, sound effects, pitch, and noise alerts is dynamically adjusted based on user input and environmental factors.

Feedback Loops: As you adjust the volume, sound effects, and noise alerts, the system optimizes sound quality.
